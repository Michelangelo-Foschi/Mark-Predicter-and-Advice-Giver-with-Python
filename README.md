# Mark-Predicter-and-Advice-Giver-with-Python
School is back on track now and some students like to keep their grades organized. So I want to build this system, where a user sets in the marks and hours worked everyday. With these inputs and a well trained neural network we should be able to predict the user's grades plus give the some advice incase the marks get worse
